;; Problem 32
;; We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

;; The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

;; Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

;; HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

;; When a * b = c, where a, b, c are positive integers, their nums of digits are d_{a,b,c} = ceil(log_10(a,b,c))
;; then, we want  certainly we have
;; d_a + d_b + d_c = 9
;; But, because d_c = ceil(log_10(a) + log_10(b)), it must be that
;; (1) d_a + d_b = d_c
;; or
;; (2) d_a + d_b = d_c + 1
;; which lead to
;; (1)' d_a + d_b = 4.5
;; and
;; (2)' d_a + d_b = 5.
;; But (1)' is impossible since d's are integers. Hence we must have d_a + d_b = 5
;; So we only have to search for the cases with (d_a, d_b) = (1, 4) or (2, 3).
